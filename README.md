A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

Characteristics of Fake News:

Their sources are not genuine.

May or may not have grammatical errors.

Often uses attention-seeking words, click baits, etc.

Seems too good to be true.

Mimics the real headlines and twists the story.

A study shows that a fake tweet on Twitter spreads six times faster than the real one. Thus, it becomes necessary to find whether a piece of news is true or fake whenever we read any information on the web.
